    <h3 style="color:gray;">about</h3>
    <p style="color:darkgrey;">
        Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly. <br>
        Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design. <br>
        Designers are toolmakers. <br>
        Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator. <br>
        Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution. <br>
        Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user. <br>
